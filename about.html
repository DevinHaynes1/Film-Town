       Hello my name is Devin Haynes and im a 15 year old who is the creator of Film Town and I created this buisness to help beggining content creators devlope the skills to video edit and the make the content that they want to create based of there ideas withought being held back. I know how it feels to not know how to video edit edit and not have tools to help me when I would spend 10-20 minutes trying to find the right video to teach me. When your not able to mirror your ideas into your content is a bad feeling that I want to help people not feel. Film Town provides advice on which software to use between the 4 main ones Davinci, Premier pro, Sony Vegas,  and filmora 9, based on what kiinda contnet you make.
